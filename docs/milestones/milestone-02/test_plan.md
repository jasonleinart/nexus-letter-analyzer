  It is my medical opinion that it is at least as likely as not 
  (greater than 50% probability) that the veteran's condition...
  """
  expected_medical_opinion_score = 20-25  # Should score highly
  
  # Test case: Letter without probability language  
  letter_without_probability = """
  The veteran's condition might possibly be related to service...
  """
  expected_medical_opinion_score = 0-10  # Should score poorly

## Test Data Requirements

### Standard Test Letters

#### High-Quality Letter (Expected Score: 85-95)
```
[Professional letterhead with credentials]
RE: Nexus Letter for Veteran Name

Based on my examination and review of medical records, it is my professional 
medical opinion that it is at least as likely as not (greater than 50% 
probability) that the veteran's current lumbar spine condition is causally 
related to the documented back injury sustained during military service.

The medical rationale is based on the temporal relationship between service 
injury and current symptoms, clinical findings consistent with service-related 
trauma, and the absence of intervening causes.

[Professional signature and credentials]
```

#### Medium-Quality Letter (Expected Score: 70-80)
```
To Whom It May Concern:

I have examined the veteran and believe his back condition is probably related 
to his military service based on his service history and current symptoms.

Dr. Smith
```

#### Poor-Quality Letter (Expected Score: 40-60)
```
The veteran says his back hurts and he thinks it started in the military.
I agree it could be related.
