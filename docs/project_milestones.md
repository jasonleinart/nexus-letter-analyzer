## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Development Approach
The milestones are designed for sequential implementation with each building upon the previous:

1. **Foundation First**: Establish core AI integration and basic functionality
2. **Business Logic**: Add sophisticated analysis and data persistence
3. **Professional Polish**: Transform into demonstration-ready system

### Time Management
- **Total Budget**: 2-4 hours maximum development time
- **Milestone 1**: Essential foundation (35-40% of time)
- **Milestone 2**: Core business value (45-50% of time)  
- **Milestone 3**: Professional presentation (15-20% of time)

### Risk Mitigation
- Each milestone produces a working system suitable for demonstration
- Early milestones focus on core functionality over polish
- Later milestones enhance presentation without risking core functionality
- Backup demonstration plan available if time constraints require
