- Medical basis: examination, records review, clinical findings

**Service Connection Component (25 points)**:
- Explicit connection statements between service and condition
- Specific service events, exposures, or injuries referenced
- Temporal relationship clarity between service and symptom onset

**Medical Rationale Component (25 points)**:
There must be scientific/clinical explanation for the connection
- Medical literature references or clinical experience citations
