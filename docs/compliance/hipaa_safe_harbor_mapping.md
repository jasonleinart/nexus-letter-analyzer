# HIPAA Safe Harbor De-identification Mapping

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 5, 2025  
**Classification**: Internal - Legal Compliance  
**Review Cycle**: Annual  

## Executive Summary

This document maps the Nexus Letter AI Analyzer system's Protected Health Information (PHI) handling to the HIPAA Safe Harbor method requirements under 45 CFR § 164.514(b)(2). The system implements comprehensive de-identification procedures to ensure compliance with federal healthcare privacy regulations.

## HIPAA Safe Harbor Identifiers Mapping

### 1. Names (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(A))

**System Implementation**:
- **Detection Pattern**: Advanced NLP-based name recognition with legal document context
- **Categories Detected**: Full names, first names, last names, nicknames, aliases
- **Redaction Method**: Replacement with role-based tokens (e.g., "[PATIENT]", "[PHYSICIAN]", "[ATTORNEY]")
- **False Positive Mitigation**: Excludes common legal/medical terms like "Veterans Affairs", "Disability Law"

**Validation Procedure**:
```
1. Manual review of 10% random sample monthly
2. Automated confidence threshold validation (>0.85)
3. Legal staff verification of edge cases
4. Quarterly pattern effectiveness assessment
```

### 2. Geographic Subdivisions Smaller than State (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(B))

**System Implementation**:
- **Detection Pattern**: ZIP codes, counties, cities, street addresses
- **Categories Detected**: 
  - ZIP codes (5-digit and ZIP+4 formats)
  - Street addresses with number/street patterns
  - City names with state context
  - County references in legal documents
- **Redaction Method**: Geographic generalization to state level only
- **Special Handling**: VA medical centers identified by general region only

**Validation Procedure**:
```
1. Geographic entity verification against USPS database
2. Manual audit of address detection accuracy
3. Validation of proper state-level generalization
4. Review of VA facility anonymization
```

### 3. Dates (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(C))

**System Implementation**:
- **Detection Pattern**: Multiple date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, written dates)
- **Categories Detected**:
  - Birth dates
  - Service dates
  - Medical examination dates
  - Legal filing dates
- **Redaction Method**: Year-only retention for dates >89 years ago, full redaction otherwise
- **Age Calculation**: Automatic age >89 detection and redaction

**Validation Procedure**:
```
1. Automated age calculation verification
2. Date format recognition testing
3. Historical date (>89 years) handling validation
4. Legal document date context preservation
```

### 4. Telephone Numbers (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(D))

**System Implementation**:
- **Detection Pattern**: Various phone number formats including international
- **Categories Detected**: Phone, fax, mobile numbers with area codes
- **Redaction Method**: Complete removal with "[PHONE REDACTED]" placeholder
- **Context Preservation**: Business vs. personal number distinction

### 5. Electronic Mail Addresses (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(E))

**System Implementation**:
- **Detection Pattern**: Email pattern recognition with domain validation
- **Redaction Method**: Domain-preserved anonymization ("[EMAIL]@domain.com")
- **Business Exception**: Professional medical/legal domains identified separately

### 6-11. Identification Numbers (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(F-K))

**System Implementation**:
- **Social Security Numbers**: Multiple format detection with checksum validation
- **Medical Record Numbers**: Healthcare-specific pattern recognition
- **Health Plan Beneficiary Numbers**: Insurance and VA benefit number patterns
- **Account Numbers**: Financial and medical account identification
- **Certificate/License Numbers**: Professional credential number detection
- **Device Identifiers**: Medical device serial numbers and identifiers

**Redaction Method**: Complete replacement with category-specific tokens

### 12-18. Advanced Identifiers (§164.514(b)(2)(i)(L-R))

**System Implementation**:
- **Vehicle Identifiers**: License plates, VIN numbers
- **Web URLs**: Complete URL redaction with domain classification
- **IP Addresses**: IPv4/IPv6 pattern detection and removal
- **Biometric Identifiers**: Fingerprint, retinal pattern references
- **Facial Photographs**: Image content scanning (when applicable)
- **Unique Identifying Numbers**: Catch-all pattern for unlisted identifiers

## Detection Patterns and Methods

### Pattern Categories

#### High-Confidence Patterns
- Social Security Numbers: `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b`
- Phone Numbers: `\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b`
- Email Addresses: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
- ZIP Codes: `\b\d{5}(-\d{4})?\b`

#### Context-Aware Patterns
- Names: NLP-based entity recognition with legal document context
- Addresses: Multi-line address block detection
- Dates: Contextual date identification (birth, service, medical)
- Medical Record Numbers: Healthcare facility-specific formats

#### False Positive Exclusions
```
Common Legal Terms Excluded:
- "Veterans Affairs", "Department of Veterans Affairs"
- "Social Security Administration"
- "Legal AI Analysis Tool"
- "Medical Center", "Healthcare System"
- Standard legal document language
- Common medical terminology
```

## Compliance Validation Procedures

### Automated Validation
- **Real-time Detection**: Confidence scoring for all PHI categories
- **Pattern Testing**: Regular expression validation against test datasets
- **False Positive Monitoring**: Automated tracking of excluded terms
- **Performance Metrics**: Detection accuracy, processing time, system reliability

### Manual Validation
- **Monthly Audits**: 10% random sample review by compliance officer
- **Legal Review**: Quarterly assessment by qualified legal counsel
- **Medical Review**: Semi-annual evaluation by healthcare privacy expert
