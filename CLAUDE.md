# 🧠 Nexus Letter AI Analyzer - Project Overview

This project focuses on building a proof-of-concept AI-powered nexus letter analysis system for disability law firms. The system demonstrates practical AI implementation for legal workflow optimization, specifically targeting the VA disability claims process.

Claude is expected to:
- Assist with requirements → design → task breakdowns for rapid development
- Track milestones and engineering progress within 2-4 hour constraint
- Support AI integration, scoring algorithm design, and UI development
- Create demonstration-ready system for interview presentation
- Operate within structured milestone development approach

---

## 🔧 Development Conventions

- Projects follow a `requirements → design → tasks` model optimized for rapid development
- Work is organized in `milestone-0X/` folders with complete documentation sets
- Each milestone includes `test_plan_draft.md`, `implementation_log.md`, and `validation_log.md`
- The `/docs/` folder contains project memory and architecture documentation
- Time-constrained development prioritizes MVP functionality and demonstration impact
- Focus on real AI integration (OpenAI GPT-4) rather than mock implementations
