RE: Nexus Letter for James Wilson, SSN: XXX-XX-1234

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Dr. Robert Martinez, M.D., board-certified orthopedic surgeon with 20 years of experience. I have been treating Mr. Wilson for chronic lower back pain and bilateral knee conditions since January 2023.

Based on my comprehensive medical evaluation, review of Mr. Wilson's service medical records, and current medical literature, it is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that Mr. Wilson's current lumbar spine condition and bilateral knee osteoarthritis are directly related to his military service.

Mr. Wilson served as an infantry soldier from 2003-2011, including two deployments to Iraq. His duties required carrying heavy equipment (often exceeding 80 pounds), jumping from vehicles, and sustained physical stress. His service medical records document multiple complaints of back and knee pain during service.

The medical rationale for this opinion includes:
1. Documented in-service injuries and complaints
2. Continuity of symptomatology since service
3. Current imaging showing degenerative changes consistent with repetitive trauma
4. Medical literature supporting the connection between military service activities and these conditions

I am available for any questions regarding this medical opinion.

Sincerely,
Dr. Robert Martinez, M.D.
Board Certified Orthopedic Surgeon
