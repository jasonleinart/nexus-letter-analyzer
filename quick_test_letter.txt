RE: Nexus Letter for James Smith, SSN: XXX-XX-1234

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Dr. Michael Brown, M.D., a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. I have been treating Mr. Smith for chronic lower back pain since 2022.

Based on my evaluation and review of his service records, it is at least as likely as not (50% or greater probability) that Mr. Smith's current lower back condition is directly related to his military service, specifically a documented injury during training exercises in 2005.

The medical evidence shows clear degenerative changes consistent with the original trauma. This opinion is based on medical records, imaging studies, and my clinical examination.

Sincerely,
Dr. Michael Brown, M.D.
