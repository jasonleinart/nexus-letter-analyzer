                [Professional Medical Practice Letterhead]
                
                RE: Nexus Letter for Veteran John Smith, SSN: XXX-XX-1234
                
                To Whom It May Concern:
                
                I am Dr. Sarah Johnson, M.D., Board Certified in Orthopedic Surgery with 15 years of experience treating service-connected disabilities. I have thoroughly examined Mr. Smith and reviewed his complete military and medical records.
                
                Based on my medical expertise and evaluation, it is my professional opinion that it is at least as likely as not (greater than 50% probability) that Mr. Smith's current lumbar spine condition is causally related to the documented injury sustained during his military service in Afghanistan in 2018.
                
                The medical rationale for this opinion includes: (1) the temporal relationship between the documented service injury and ongoing symptoms, (2) clinical findings consistent with service-related trauma, and (3) the absence of intervening causes that would explain the current condition.
                
                This opinion is rendered to a reasonable degree of medical certainty based on current medical literature and my clinical experience.
                
                Sincerely,
                Dr. Sarah Johnson, M.D.

                Hi,
                
                I looked at the veteran's back problems. He says it started in the military and I think that's probably right based on what he told me.
                
                The back pain seems related to his service but I'm not completely sure. There might be other causes too.
                
                Hope this helps.
