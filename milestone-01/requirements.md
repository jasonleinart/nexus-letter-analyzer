- Defer advanced features to later milestones

### Technology Requirements
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (rapid development, professional appearance)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 API (latest available model)
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via python-dotenv

### Performance Requirements
- API response time: < 30 seconds for typical letter analysis
- Text processing: Handle letters up to 10,000 characters
- Memory usage: Reasonable for local development environment

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
1. **API Integration**: Successfully connect to and receive responses from OpenAI GPT-4
2. **Text Processing**: Clean and process sample nexus letters correctly
3. **Web Interface**: Professional-looking Streamlit app loads and functions
4. **Error Handling**: Application handles common error scenarios gracefully

### Business Success Metrics

2. **Legal Domain Understanding**: AI responses relevant to nexus letter evaluation
3. **Professional Presentation**: Interface suitable for demonstration to legal professionals
4. **Foundation for Growth**: Architecture supports planned enhancements in later milestones

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- OpenAI API access and valid API key
- Internet connectivity for API calls
- Python 3.9+ runtime environment

### Internal Dependencies
- None (this is the foundation milestone)

## Deliverables

1. **Core Application Files**:
   - `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
   - `ai_analyzer.py` - OpenAI API integration module
   - `text_processor.py` - Text cleaning and preprocessing
   - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
   - `config.py` - Application configuration management

3. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Setup and running instructions
   - `DEMO.md` - Demonstration script for interviews

4. **Sample Data**:

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **OpenAI API Issues**: Have backup prompts and error handling ready
2. **Time Overrun**: Focus on minimal viable functionality first
3. **Technical Setup Issues**: Test on fresh environment before demonstration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Keep functionality scope minimal but working
- Use well-documented libraries (Streamlit, openai)
- Test with multiple sample letters during development
- Have fallback demonstration plan if API issues occur
