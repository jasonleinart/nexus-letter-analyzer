# Milestone 1: Test Plan Draft

## Testing Overview

This test plan outlines the validation strategy for Milestone 1 core infrastructure, focusing on real AI integration, text processing reliability, and user interface functionality. Given the 1-1.5 hour development constraint, testing emphasizes critical path validation and demonstration readiness.

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Manual Testing Primary**: Focus on functional validation and user experience
- **Unit Testing Selective**: Critical functions only due to time constraints
- **Integration Testing Essential**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Common failure modes must be handled gracefully

### Testing Environment
- **Local Development**: Python 3.9+ with fresh virtual environment
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome (primary), Firefox and Safari (basic validation)
- **API Testing**: Real OpenAI GPT-4 API calls with valid credentials
- **Network Conditions**: Test with normal and degraded connectivity

## Test Categories

### 1. Component Unit Tests

#### 1.1 Text Processing Tests (`text_processor.py`)

**TEST-1.1.1: Text Cleaning Functionality**
- **Purpose**: Validate text preprocessing handles various input formats
- **Test Cases**:
  ```python
  # Test case: Normal nexus letter text
  input_text = "   RE: Nexus Letter for John Doe\n\n\nThis is to certify...   "
  expected_output = "RE: Nexus Letter for John Doe\n\nThis is to certify..."
  
  # Test case: OCR artifacts and formatting issues
  input_text = "RE:  Nexus   Letter\nfor    John\n\n\n\nDoe"
  expected_output = "RE: Nexus Letter\nfor John\n\nDoe"
  ```
- **Expected Result**: Clean, readable text with preserved medical terminology
- **Validation Method**: Manual inspection of processed output

**TEST-1.1.2: Input Validation**
- **Purpose**: Ensure text validation catches invalid inputs
- **Test Cases**:
  - Empty string → Should return (False, "Text cannot be empty")
  - Short text (< 100 chars) → Should return (False, "Text too short for analysis")
  - Very long text (> 10,000 chars) → Should return (False, "Text exceeds maximum length")
  - Valid nexus letter → Should return (True, "")
- **Expected Result**: Accurate validation with helpful error messages
- **Validation Method**: Assert validation results match expected outcomes

#### 1.2 AI Analyzer Tests (`ai_analyzer.py`)

## Test Data

### Sample Nexus Letters for Testing

#### High-Quality Sample (should score well)
```
[Medical Facility Name]
[Address]
[Date]

RE: Nexus Letter for John Veteran

To Whom It May Concern,

I am Dr. Jane Smith, M.D., specializing in orthopedic medicine with 15 years of experience treating service-connected disabilities.

Based on my examination of Mr. Veteran's medical records and service history, it is my professional medical opinion that it is at least as likely as not (greater than 50% probability) that his current lumbar spine condition is related to his military service.

The medical rationale for this opinion is based on the documented back injury during his deployment in 2010, the continuous medical treatment since discharge, and the clinical findings consistent with service-related trauma.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jane Smith, M.D.
License #12345

#### Poor-Quality Sample (should identify issues)
```
Hi,

I think the veteran's back problems are probably related to military service. He told me about an injury a while ago.

Hope this helps.
