# Nexus Letter AI Analyzer - Project Requirements

## Project Overview

Build a functional AI-powered nexus letter analysis system for disability law firms. This is a proof-of-concept demonstration for Disability Law Group's AI Systems & Technology Integration Manager position, showcasing practical AI implementation for legal workflow optimization.

## Business Context

### What is a Nexus Letter?
A nexus letter is a medical opinion that establishes a connection between a veteran's current medical condition and their military service. These letters are critical evidence in VA disability claims and must meet specific legal and medical standards.

### Business Problem
- Disability law firms process hundreds of nexus letters monthly
- Manual review is time-intensive and inconsistent
- Letters must meet strict VA compliance requirements
- Missing elements cause claim delays and rejections
- High-volume workflow creates attorney bottlenecks

### Success Criteria
- Demonstrate real AI integration (not mock data)
- Show practical legal workflow understanding
- Provide measurable efficiency improvements
- Maintain attorney oversight and control
- Create professional, deployable proof-of-concept

## User Stories & Requirements

### 1. Document Analysis System

**User Story:** As a disability attorney, I want to upload nexus letters and receive automated quality analysis so I can quickly identify issues before submission to the VA.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. WHEN I upload a nexus letter text THEN the system extracts and processes the content
2. WHEN the system analyzes the letter THEN it checks for all required VA compliance elements
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN I receive a numerical score (0-100) with detailed breakdown
4. WHEN issues are found THEN the system provides specific recommendations for improvement
5. WHEN the letter meets standards THEN the system recommends approval pathway

### 2. AI-Powered Content Evaluation

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want AI to evaluate nexus letters against VA requirements so I can ensure compliance before submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system checks for "at least as likely as not" medical opinion language
2. WHEN reviewing service connection THEN the system verifies military service linkage is present
3. WHEN evaluating medical rationale THEN the system confirms medical reasoning is provided
4. WHEN checking credentials THEN the system verifies doctor qualification statements
5. WHEN assessing format THEN the system confirms professional business letter structure

### 3. Scoring and Decision System

**User Story:** As a law firm manager, I want consistent scoring criteria so all nexus letters are evaluated using the same standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. WHEN scoring letters THEN the system uses weighted criteria: Medical Opinion (25%), Service Connection (25%), Medical Rationale (25%), Professional Format (25%)
2. WHEN score is 85-100 THEN the system recommends "Auto-Approve"
3. WHEN score is 70-84 THEN the system recommends "Attorney Review"
4. WHEN score is below 70 THEN the system recommends "Revision Required"
5. WHEN providing scores THEN the system explains the reasoning for each component

### 4. Review Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a practice administrator, I want to track review history and performance metrics so I can measure system effectiveness and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. WHEN letters are analyzed THEN the system logs timestamp, score, and decision
2. WHEN viewing history THEN I can see all previous reviews with key metrics
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system shows average scores, approval rates, and trend analysis
4. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system calculates time savings and efficiency gains
5. WHEN reviewing data THEN I can export results for further analysis

### 5. User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As an attorney or staff member, I want an intuitive interface so I can efficiently review letters without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. WHEN using the system THEN I have a clean, professional web interface
2. WHEN uploading letters THEN I can paste text directly or upload files
3. WHEN viewing results THEN I see clear visual indicators (colors, icons) for pass/fail status
4. WHEN reviewing recommendations THEN I receive specific, actionable improvement suggestions
5. WHEN navigating the system THEN I can easily access all functions from a simple menu

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (rapid development, professional appearance)

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Deployment:** Local development with cloud deployment capability

### Key Components

#### 1. Document Processing Engine
```python
def process_nexus_letter(text_input):
    # Clean and prepare text for analysis
    # Extract key sections if structured
    # Return processed content for AI analysis
```

#### 2. AI Analysis Module
```python
def analyze_with_openai(letter_content):
    # Real OpenAI GPT-4 API integration
    # Custom prompts for nexus letter evaluation
    # Structured JSON response with scores and feedback
    # Error handling and retry logic
```

#### 3. Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_scores(ai_response):
    # Convert AI analysis to numerical scores
    # Apply weighted scoring criteria
    # Determine approval recommendation
    # Generate improvement suggestions
```

#### 4. Data Persistence Layer
```python
def log_review_results(letter_id, scores, decision):
    # SQLite database for review history
    # Track performance metrics
    # Enable analytics and reporting
```

### Required Analysis Criteria

Based on VA nexus letter requirements, the system must evaluate:

1. **Medical Opinion Statement (25 points)**
   - Presence of "at least as likely as not" or equivalent language
   - Clear medical probability statement (>50% likelihood)
   - Definitive medical opinion, not speculation

2. **Service Connection Linkage (25 points)**
   - Explicit connection between current condition and military service
   - Reference to specific service events, exposures, or injuries
   - Temporal relationship between service and condition onset

3. **Medical Rationale (25 points)**
   - Scientific/medical explanation for the connection
   - Reference to medical literature or clinical experience
   - Logical reasoning supporting the opinion

4. **Professional Format & Credentials (25 points)**
   - Proper business letter format
   - Doctor's credentials and qualifications stated
   - Professional medical language and tone
   - Signature and contact information

RE: Nexus Letter for [Mr. Veteran's Full Name]

To Whom It May Concern,

I am [Your Full Name], a licensed [Your Professional Title], specializing in [Your Area of Expertise]. I have reviewed Mr. Veteran's medical records and service history in detail. Based on my evaluation, I believe there is a connection between his current sleep apnea and his service connected tinnitus with the resulting major depressive disorder and subsequent weight gain as an intermediate step.

In my professional medical opinion, it is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) that Mr. Veteran's sleep apnea is secondary to his service connected tinnitus with the resulting major depressive disorder and subsequent weight gain as an intermediate step.

It is also my professional opinion that it is at least as likely as not that the aforementioned service-connected disabilities caused him to become obese, that the obesity is a result of his service-connected PTSD, and that the sleep apnea would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the aforementioned service-connected disabilities.

The persistent ringing in his ears has caused ongoing sleep disturbances, major depressive disorder and weight gain, which are well-documented contributions to the development and worsening of sleep apnea.

This opinion is based on the medical evidence, my clinical evaluation, and professional expertise. If further information is needed, please contact me at [Phone Number] or [Email Address].

Sincerely,

[Physician's Signature]
[Your Full Name, Degree]
[Your Title/Professional Designation]
[License Number, if applicable]
